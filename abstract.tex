In this paper we will present the current status of Rameau, a system
for automatic harmonic analysis and computational musicology.
Currently, Rameau has nine algorithms for chord name analysis and four
algorithms for roman numeral analysis. Also, Rameau has commands to
find consecutive octaves and fifths, list the chords types used in a
music, find voice crossings, vocal range, and melodic jumps, analyze
how the seventh of chords are resolved, list how many chord
progressions found are strong, weak, superstrong and neutral, and
analyze the final cadence of a set of chorales. Although the initial
finds are promissing, the input data needs to be further corrected and
the functions for musicology need to be further tested, debuged, and
refined. Also, the Rameau architeture is too tied to 4-voice part
writing, but we plan to address these problems in a future release of
Rameau.
