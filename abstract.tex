In this paper we will present the current status of Rameau, a system
for automatic harmonic analysis and computational musicology.
Currently, Rameau has nine algorithms for chord name analysis and four
algorithms for roman numeral analysis. Also, rameau has a good number
of commands to find consecutive octaves and fifths, list the chords
types used in a music, voice crossings, vocal range, melodic jumps,
analyze how the seventh of chords are resolved, how many chord
progressions found are strong, weak, superstrong and neutral, and
analyze the final cadence of a set of chorales. Although the initial
finds are promissing, the input data needs to be further corrected and
the functions for musicology need to be further tested, debuged, and
refined. The rameau architeture is too tied to 4-voice part writing.
We plan to address these problems in a future release of rameau.
